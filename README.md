# Enhanced-multimodal-rag ü§ñüìÑ

After months of dedicated design and development, I'm thrilled to share a fully functional version of an advanced document analysis and chat application, Enhanced-Multimodal-RAG. This tool seamlessly integrates multiple OCR engines, including Mistral OCR for superior accuracy and Marker enhanced with the latest Gemini 2.5 Flash model, with a state-of-the-art Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG) pipeline for intelligent document interaction. The system leverages a hybrid query approach, combining semantic embeddings from Gemini with BM25 keyword search to deliver precise and contextually relevant results. A special thanks to https://github.com/VikParuchuri/marker/tree/master/marker, which served as the foundation for one of the parsing engines, fine-tuned to maximize performance with Gemini integration.
